# Free Account Tips

There's a few settings designed to help make the *Free-to-use* mode a bit more user-friendly but they aren't enabled by default. They are described below.

## On-Demand clipboard listening

By pausing the clipboard listener (by clicking *System Tray->Pause* or <kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>F1</kbd>) a ðŸŽ¯ icon will appear in the top-right of the *Pin Tray* **when there is something** ***new*** on the clipboard. 
<p><img class="figure narrow" src={require('/img/free_acct_sug_bullseye_btn.png').default} /></p>

Now the ***only*** time MonkeyPaste will read the clipboard is when you click the ðŸŽ¯ button or the <kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>F9</kbd> global shortcut.

:::tip Set it in stone
If you like keeping the *Clipboard Listener* paused, you can uncheck *Settings->Preferences->Listen To Clipboard On Startup* to avoid having to pause it everytime you use MonkeyPaste.

## Capacity Hints & Watermarks

- Capacity notifications can be permanently hidden from the 3 dots menu 
- Cap clip watermark warnings can be hidden by checking *Settings->Preferences->Hide Capacity Watermarks*

## Transitioning from a free-trial

If you tried the *Unlimited* plan and decided not to pay for it you'll probably have a fair amount of entries stored up. To keep this monetization method afloat the cap system **ensures things added to your storage with the** ***paid plan*** **are not lost to recycling**. 

So let's say you had 100 clips at the end of the trial. Then your capacity won't *ever* go over 100 after that, **but** to prevent giving trial users a **rolling** storage of 100 items, the cap system picks clips **on or after the trial ends** which *may* make organizing your stuff pretty confusing, I get that but there's not much that can be done beyond the tip below...

:::tip Clean slate
You can delete your storage at any time from *Settings->Preferences->System->Delete All Clips*
