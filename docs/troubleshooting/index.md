## Random application freezing?
In some scenerios if you have switchable graphics cards MonkeyPaste will freeze and you have to restart the application. 

1. In your windows settings go to *System->Display->Graphics* or just press <kbd>ðŸªŸ</kbd> and type 'Graphics'
2. In *Custom Options For Apps->Add an app* select 'Microsoft Store App'
3. Search or scroll down then highlight 'MonkeyPaste' and select *Options*
4. In the pop up select a **specific card**. High-performance is preferred just as long as **'Let Windows Decide' is not selected**
