# Trash
The trash collection allows a layer of separation between your working set of clips and ones that are permenently deleted.

:::info Trash is a state not a place
No permanent changes are the result of trashing a clip. Any shortcuts, linked tag or other associated data is retained ***until the clip is permanently deleted***.
:::

## Adding clips to trash
Clips can be moved to the trash in a few ways: 
- Pressing the <kbd>Del</kbd> key on a selected clip
- The **Trash** button found in a selected clip's context menu (right-click or hold on mobile) 
- Automatically occurs as part of [content recycling](docs/account/index.md#content)

:::tip
Selected clips can skip the trash and be permanently deleted using the <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> shortcut.
