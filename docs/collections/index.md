# Collections

There are 3 basic types of collections to help you organize your clips:
- [Tags](#tags)
- [Filters](#filters)
- [Groups](#groups)

## [Tags](tags)
Tag collections are a way to classify your clips in some meaningful way and are oraganized hierarchically.

## [Filters](filters)
Filters are like saved searches or queries that will show clips based on criteria you provide in [basic](filters#simple-search-filter) or [advanced](filters#advanced-filters) searches.

## [Groups](groups)
Groups are simply a way to organize filters. 

# Organization
Collections are located in the collections tab of the main window sidebar. They are separated into 3 distinct sections:
1. [Filters](#filters)
2. [Tags](#tags)
3. [Trash]
