# Filters

Filter collections are stored searches that reflect results based on when they are clicked or *queried*.

:::tip Filter Refreshing
Even if a filter is already selected, clicking it again will refresh the results. This can be meaningful if the filter uses the present time as a criteria. (An example of a present time criteria can be seen by selecting and expanding the 'Recent' filter)
:::

There are 2 types of filters:
1. [Simple Search](#simple-search-filter)
2. [Advanced](#advanced-filters)

## Simple Search Filter
:::caution 
Simple search is limited to the current **active collection** (Group collections cannot be active). 
:::

:::tip
To search against all clips you need to select the **All** collection.
:::

Simple search is a quick or more general type of method to filter your clips. 

### In-Place search
There are 2 ways to reveal the simple search filter:
1. Click the ðŸ”Ž button in the top-right of the main window
2. Start typing at any time when the main window is active and no input control is in focus

:::tip Live-Search
Live-Search is an optional feature that can be enabled or disabled at anytime from the *Settings->Preferences->Search* menu
:::

### Simple Search Options
With the simple search filter expanded, options are available by clicking on the ðŸ”Ž icon.

The simple search options are broken up into 3 groups and will be used in conjunction with the text you type into the search box. The 3 groups are:
1. [Fields](#field-options)
2. [Formats](#format-options)
3. [Operations](#operation-options)

#### Field Options
The actual property of the clip, its source or meta-information on it (ie. Title or annotation) to compare with the search text enetered.

#### Format Options
The basic format of clips to include in the filter, being text,files or images.

:::caution
Be aware that format selection is **required** and attempting to de-select all 3 formats will reset the format group to default (all selected). Otherwise there would be no results ðŸ™ˆ.
:::

#### Operation Options
These are standard matching operations you can enable to further refine the results.

:::caution
Enabling *Regular Expression* will disable the other options. If you want to include case-sensitivity or whole-word matching that needs to be supplied in the provided expression.
:::

## Advanced Filters
Advanced filtering extends from some [simple filter](#simple-search-filter) which can be blank and includes all results from the default options. 

### Overview
Advanced filtering works by performing the provided filters in the **order they are listed**, always from the base-level simple search filter. The final output is the result of the provided [join operation](#join-operations) of some given filter against the results of the **last** filter. This flow is similar to a [feed-back loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback) which can provide a wide-range of intuitive and meaningful results. 

### Creating Advanced Filters
There are a few way to create filters but here are the most common:

#### *Collections Sidebar*
1. Select 'Filters' or any 'ðŸ—€ Group' collection within it from the *Collections* side-bar
2. Click or tap the âž• plus button in the top right of the the *Collections* side-bar to reveal the *Add collection* pop-up menu
3. Select 'Filter'
4. A new Filter will be added to the bottom of the selected Collection.

#### Expanding a simple search 
1. [Create a simple search](#in-place-search)
2. Click the âž• plus button to the right of the search box to reveaul the *advanced search panel*
3. Click the **Save** button at the top of the panel to save the filter to the root 'Filters' collection or selecting something else to discard

:::tip 
Changes to filters will only persist by clicking the **Save** button at the top of the *advanced search panel*.
:::

#### Duplicating 
With the *advanced search panel* open click the **Duplicate** button at the top of the panel to duplicate the filter. The new filter will be added to the root 'Filters' menu with the selected filters name and the suffix ' Copy'.

:::caution
The duplicated filter will be based on the last save version of the current filter
:::

:::tip
MonkeyPaste comes with a handful of read-only filters out-of-the-box ('All', 'Recent' and the 3 content formats under the 'Formats' group). To experiment with these, exapnd their advanced panel menu and duplicate to extend or alter the results.
:::

### Advanced Criteria Items
Each advanced criteria filter is row of the *advanced search panel*. That produces results like the the *simple search filter* but with a much broader range of clip and input properties to compare against.

#### Adding Criteria 
To add a new criteria filter, hover over any criteria in the *advanced search panel* and click the âž• plus button that appears in the top-right of the item. The new item will be added below it.

:::tip Criteria Drag-and-drop
Criteria filters can be moved or duplicated (+<kbd>Control</kbd>) using the criteria drag handle on the left-side of the filter.
:::

#### Join Operations

##### Join Types

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```
There are 3 types of join operations available for criteria options.

:::note
***Or*** is the default type of criteria and the join type drop down menu is hidden when this is the current *join type*.
:::
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="abd" label="And âˆ©">
    Only results from the input and current criteria will be passed to the next item
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="or" label="Or âˆª" default>
    All input results will be combined with current criteria and passed to the next item.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="not" label="Not âŠ„">
  Any results from the input that also in current criteria will be omitted
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

##### Changing the type
To change a criteria's join type, hover or select the criteria click the â‹® 3 dots on top-right of the item to reveal the *criteria join type menu*.
